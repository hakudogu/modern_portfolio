            You have found me my child, my sister, my friend, Isay. I have seen all your struggles,
            your thoughts, your fears, your doubt, and I like to reassure it is normal, and that does not
            make you less of a person, I love you nevertheless. I witnessed how strong a person you are and you know it,
            you just need to remind yourself that you are strong, because I guarantee it. I admire your brave yet fragile heart. 
            It is what I love about you. My Child, join me in praying for the needy, for the afflicted, for the suffering,
            and for vocations. If you ever need a reminder of how strong and loved you are, look for me again.

            These are roses I shower upon you. I lift you up unto the Lord in prayer. My God, please protect Isay from
            the troubles of mental health and emotional suffering, empower and encourage her so that she becomes stronger ever,
            such that she knows what to aspire for, help her decide with strength and clarity of mind. Make her feel your presence 
            through the people around her. Allow her to be braver than ever. Allow her to see your her path through your light. May you shelter
            her from harm and evil, and may you provide her everything she needs to succeed and flourish, Amen.
